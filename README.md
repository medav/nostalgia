# Nostalgia

## What is this?
This is a repository of all my **very old** projects that I messed around with when I started programming. It ranges from when I started in 6th grade in 2005 to when I started working as a high school intern for Rockwell Collins in 2011.

## Disclaimer
The point of this repository is purely to archive my old work for looking back. **None of this should be used as a reflection of my current abilities as a programmer.** If you want to want to see my current portfolio of work, take a look at my website [here](http://www.michaeledavies.com).

## What now?
Take a look and have some fun! I will try to add descriptions of each projects and maybe even how to build and run them if desired.
